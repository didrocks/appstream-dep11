# Debian DEP-11 Python module

This Python module allows you to generate and validate DEP-11 metadata.
It is used by dak (the Debian Archive Kit) and may be used by others.

[DEP-11](https://wiki.debian.org/DEP-11) is Debian's YAML-based version
of the [AppStream distro metadata](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-DistroData.html#sect-AppStream-ASXML).
