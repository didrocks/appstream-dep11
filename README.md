# Debian AppStream DEP-11 tools

This Python module allows you to generate and validate DEP-11 metadata,
which is Debians implementation of AppStream.
The tools can be used standalone, or be integrated with other services.

You can find out more about DEP-11 YAML at the [Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/DEP-11), and more about
AppStream distro metadata at [Freedesktop](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-DistroData.html#sect-AppStream-ASXML).
